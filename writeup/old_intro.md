Recent advancements in satellite technology and sensor data have significantly enhanced our capability to monitor environmental phenomena through time series analysis of images. Efficiently extracting relevant time series features at scale remains challenging, necessitating automated and robust methods. Inspired by `tsfresh` (Time Series FeatuRe Extraction on basis of Scalable Hypothesis tests), we introduce `xr_fresh`, tailored specifically for image time series,by automating the extraction of time series features on a pixel-by-pixel basis [@CHRIST201872].

Time series data, characterized by sequences of measurements indexed over time, are ubiquitous in diverse fields, including finance, healthcare, industrial monitoring, and environmental sciences [@faouzi2022time]. Analyzing and modeling these temporal sequences for tasks such as classification (assigning a time series to a predefined category) or regression (predicting a continuous value associated with a time series) is a fundamental problem in machine learning [@faouzi2022time]. However, applying standard machine learning algorithms directly to raw time series data is often challenging due to the inherent temporal structure and potentially high dimensionality of the sequences [@faouzi2022time]. An effective representation of the time series characteristics is crucial for building accurate and robust models [@mumuni2024automated;@faouzi2022time].

Traditional approaches to time series analysis and machine learning often rely on manual feature engineering, a process in which domain experts handcraft relevant features from raw data [@li2020forecasting]. Although effective in specific contexts, this process is labor intensive, requires significant expertise, and may not generalize well across different datasets or tasks [@li2020forecasting;@faouzi2022time]. The increasing volume and complexity of modern time series data require more automated and scalable approaches to data processing and feature extraction  [@mumuni2024automated;@li2020forecasting].

A prominent tool in this domain is `tsfresh` [@CHRIST201872], a Python package specifically designed for time series feature extraction based on scalable hypothesis tests   [jin2022automated;@mumuni2024automated;@gilpin2021chaos;@schroeder2019chemiresistive;@sylligardos2023choose;@mcdermott2023event;@petropoulos2022forecasting;@zhao2022ai]. `tsfresh` automates the process of calculating a diverse and large number of features from time series data. These features are derived from existing research and include distribution properties (e.g., mean, standard deviation, kurtosis), measures of autocorrelation (e.g., fast Fourier transform (FFT) and power spectral density coefficients), properties of linear regressors (e.g., gradient, standard error), energy, entropy, and stochasticity [@CHRIST201872]. After feature extraction, `tsfresh` also offers automated feature selection methods, such as using statistical tests like the Mann-Whitney U test, to identify and select the most relevant features for a specific task [@CHRIST201872].

Gridded time series data from satellites, climate models, camera feeds, and sensors contain rich temporal information for applications like crop type classification and yields, anomaly detection, robotics, quality control, environmental monitoring, and natural resource management [@delince2017handbook;@mumuni2024automated;@hufkens2019monitoring;@MANN201760;@mann2019predicting]. Traditional methods relied heavily on manually engineered features, which are time-consuming, require domain expertise, and often lack scalability.

Deep learning (DL) has largely supplanted traditional machine learning (ML) methods in a variety of fields, including the analysis of gridded remote sensing data [@LI2023103345;@MA2019166]. This shift is attributed to the capabilities of DL algorithms in handling the massive volume and complexity of remote sensing big data (RSBD) [@LI2023103345]. Traditional methods have largely relied on hand-crafted feature descriptors which are effective only in limited situations and struggle to balance generalization and robustness when dealing with RSBD [@delince2017handbook]. In contrast, deep learning models automatically extract rich hierarchical features directly from the data, learning weights from vast amounts of information. This ability to learn deep representative features is particularly effective for multi-temporal remote sensing data analysis, such as crop type mapping. Although traditional ML methods such as Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines have been successfully applied to classify different crop types, they typically rely on shallow and hand-crafted features and struggle to capture the complex temporal patterns of crop growth [@zhang2024improving]. Compared to traditional ML models, deep learning models often have a much larger number of trainable parameters and, when trained with sufficient data or augmented techniques, can learn more comprehensive and generalized features, sometimes achieving comparable or superior accuracy even with fewer training samples [@zhang2024improving]. The rapid development of computing power and the availability of big data have enabled deep learning to surpass traditional methods in various remote sensing tasks, including scene classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, change detection, and land use and land cover (LULC) classification [@LI2023103345;@MA2019166;@LI2023103345]. Although traditional ML is still used, the remote sensing community has notably shifted its focus to deep learning since around 2014 due to its significant success in many image analysis tasks [@MA2019166].

Traditional machine learning approaches are well suited for analyzing gridded time series data from a variety of sources, including remote sensing platforms, in ssitu sensors, and climate reanalysis products. These methods can effectively leverage spatial and temporal patterns within the data, capturing key trends and anomalies across environmental variables  [@begue2018remote;@delince2017handbook]. Compared to deep learning architectures, traditional machine learning offers greater interpretability and lower computational overhead [@hohl2024recent]. In a recent study, `xr_fresh` ML methods outperformed a variety of deep learning methods for crop classification using monthly Sentinel-2 images [@venkatachalam2024temporal]. Their transparent decision-making processes can be easily examined by domain experts, communicated to non-technical stakeholders, and they typically require less training data and computational power, making them ideal for many operational or resource-constrained applications, such as on edge devices or research in developing countries [@hohl2024recent;@rs13132591;@LI2023103345;@MA2019166]. Currently, there is no method to rapidly extract a comprehensive set of features from gridded time series data, such as those derived from remote sensing imagery. Existing packages like `tsfresh` are not optimized for the unique characteristics of gridded time series data, which often include irregular sampling intervals, missing values, and high dimensionality. This limitation hinders the ability to efficiently analyze and model these datasets, particularly in the context of remote sensing applications where large volumes of data are generated.

To address this gap, `xr_fresh` automates the extraction of salient temporal and statistical features from each pixel time series. Using automated feature extraction, `xr_fresh` reduces manual intervention and improves reproducibility in remote sensing workflows.

The Python package tsfresh (Time Series FeatuRe Extraction on basis of Scalable Hypothesis tests) accelerates this process by combining 63 time series characterization methods, which by default compute a total of 794 time series features, with feature selection on basis automatically configured hypothesis tests. By identifying statistically significant time series characteristics in an early stage of the data science process, tsfresh closes feedback loops with domain experts and fosters the development of domain specific features early on. The package implements standard APIs of time series and machine learning libraries (e.g. pandas and scikit-learn) and is designed for both exploratory analyses as well as straightforward integration into operational data science applications.}

abstract = {With many platforms and sensors continuously observing the earth surface, the large amount of remote sensing data presents a big data challenge. While remote sensing data acquisition capability can fully meet the requirements of many application domains, there is still a need to further explore how to efficiently mine the useful information from remote sensing big data (RSBD). Many researchers in the remote sensing community have introduced deep learning in the process of RSBD, and deep learning-based methods have achieved better performance compared with traditional methods. However, there are still substantial obstacles to the application of deep learning in remote sensing. One of the major challenges is the generation of pixel-level labels with high quality for training samples, which is essential to deep learning models. Weakly supervised deep learning (WSDL) is a promising solution to address this problem as WSDL can utilize greedily labeled datasets that are easy to collect but not ideal to train the deep networks. In this review, we summarize the achievements of WSDL-driven cost-efficient information extraction from RSBD. We first analyze the opportunities and challenges of information extraction from RSBD. Based on the analysis of the theoretical foundations of WSDL in the computer vision (CV) domain, we conduct a survey on the WSDL-based information extraction methods under the data characteristic and task demand of RSBD in four different tasks: (i) scene classification, (ii) object detection, (iii) semantic segmentation and (iv) change detection. Finally, potential research directions are outlined to guide researchers to further exploit WSDL-based information extraction from RSBD.}

Subsequently, a detailed review is conducted to describe/discuss how DL has been applied for remote sensing image analysis tasks including image fusion, image registration, scene classification, object detection, land use and land cover (LULC) classification, segmentation, and object-based image analysis (OBIA). This review covers nearly every application and technology in the field of remote sensing, ranging from preprocessing to mapping.

In this paper, we explore the determinants of wheat output per hectare in Ethiopia during the 2011â€“2013 principal Meher crop seasons at the kebele administrative area. Using a panel data approach, combining national agricultural field surveys with relevant GIS and remote sensing products, the model explains nearly 40% of the total variation in wheat output per hectare across the country. Reflecting on the high interannual variability in output per hectare, we explore whether these changes can be explained by weather, shocks to, and management of rain-fed agricultural systems. The model identifies specific contributors to wheat yields that include farm management techniques (e.g. area planted, improved seed, fertilizer, and irrigation), weather (e.g. rainfall), water availability (e.g. vegetation and moisture deficit indexes) and policy intervention. Our findings suggest that woredas produce between 9.8 and 86.5% of their locally attainable wheat yields given their altitude, weather conditions, terrain, and plant health. In conclusion, we believe the combination of field surveys with spatial data can be used to identify management priorities for improving production at a variety of administrative levels.}

ABSTRACT = {Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning (DL) has a wide variety of applications in the geospatial and remote sensing (RS) sciences, and consequently has been a focus of many recent studies. However, a review of accuracy assessment methods used in recently published RS DL studies, focusing on scene classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation, indicates that RS DL papers appear to follow an accuracy assessment approach that diverges from that of traditional RS studies. Papers reporting on RS DL studies have largely abandoned traditional RS accuracy assessment terminology; they rarely reported a complete confusion matrix; and sampling designs and analysis protocols generally did not provide a population-based confusion matrix, in which the table entries are estimates of the probabilities of occurrence of the mapped landscape. These issues indicate the need for the RS community to develop guidance on best practices for accuracy assessment for CNN-based DL thematic mapping and object detection. As a first step in that process, we explore key issues, including the observation that accuracy assessments should not be biased by the CNN-based training and inference processes that rely on image chips. Furthermore, accuracy assessments should be consistent with prior recommendations and standards in the field, should support the estimation of a population confusion matrix, and should allow for assessment of model generalization. This paper draws from our review of the RS DL literature and the rich record of traditional remote sensing accuracy assessment research while considering the unique nature of CNN-based deep learning to propose accuracy assessment best practices that use appropriate sampling methods, training and validation data partitioning, assessment metrics, and reporting standards.},
