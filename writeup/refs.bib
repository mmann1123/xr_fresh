abstract = {Time series feature engineering is a time-consuming process because scientists and engineers have to consider the multifarious algorithms of signal processing and time series analysis for identifying and extracting meaningful features from time series. The Python package tsfresh (Time Series FeatuRe Extraction on basis of Scalable Hypothesis tests) accelerates this process by combining 63 time series characterization methods, which by default compute a total of 794 time series features, with feature selection on basis automatically configured hypothesis tests. By identifying statistically significant time series characteristics in an early stage of the data science process, tsfresh closes feedback loops with domain experts and fosters the development of domain specific features early on. The package implements standard APIs of time series and machine learning libraries (e.g. pandas and scikit-learn) and is designed for both exploratory analyses as well as straightforward integration into operational data science applications.}

abstract = {With many platforms and sensors continuously observing the earth surface, the large amount of remote sensing data presents a big data challenge. While remote sensing data acquisition capability can fully meet the requirements of many application domains, there is still a need to further explore how to efficiently mine the useful information from remote sensing big data (RSBD). Many researchers in the remote sensing community have introduced deep learning in the process of RSBD, and deep learning-based methods have achieved better performance compared with traditional methods. However, there are still substantial obstacles to the application of deep learning in remote sensing. One of the major challenges is the generation of pixel-level labels with high quality for training samples, which is essential to deep learning models. Weakly supervised deep learning (WSDL) is a promising solution to address this problem as WSDL can utilize greedily labeled datasets that are easy to collect but not ideal to train the deep networks. In this review, we summarize the achievements of WSDL-driven cost-efficient information extraction from RSBD. We first analyze the opportunities and challenges of information extraction from RSBD. Based on the analysis of the theoretical foundations of WSDL in the computer vision (CV) domain, we conduct a survey on the WSDL-based information extraction methods under the data characteristic and task demand of RSBD in four different tasks: (i) scene classification, (ii) object detection, (iii) semantic segmentation and (iv) change detection. Finally, potential research directions are outlined to guide researchers to further exploit WSDL-based information extraction from RSBD.}

abstract = {Deep learning (DL) algorithms have seen a massive rise in popularity for remote-sensing image analysis over the past few years. In this study, the major DL concepts pertinent to remote-sensing are introduced, and more than 200 publications in this field, most of which were published during the last two years, are reviewed and analyzed. Initially, a meta-analysis was conducted to analyze the status of remote sensing DL studies in terms of the study targets, DL model(s) used, image spatial resolution(s), type of study area, and level of classification accuracy achieved. Subsequently, a detailed review is conducted to describe/discuss how DL has been applied for remote sensing image analysis tasks including image fusion, image registration, scene classification, object detection, land use and land cover (LULC) classification, segmentation, and object-based image analysis (OBIA). This review covers nearly every application and technology in the field of remote sensing, ranging from preprocessing to mapping. Finally, a conclusion regarding the current state-of-the art methods, a critical conclusion on open challenges, and directions for future research are presented.}
