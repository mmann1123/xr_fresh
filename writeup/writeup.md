## Introduction

Recent advancements in satellite technology and open-access remote sensing data have significantly enhanced our capability to monitor environmental phenomena through gridded time series analysis. Efficiently extracting relevant time series features at scale remains challenging, necessitating automated and robust methods. Inspired by tsfresh (Time Series FeatuRe Extraction on basis of Scalable Hypothesis tests), we introduce `xr_fresh`, tailored specifically for remote sensing datasets, to address this need by automating the extraction of time series features on a pixel-by-pixel basis.

Time series data, characterized by sequences of measurements indexed over time, are ubiquitous across diverse fields, including finance, healthcare, industrial monitoring, and environmental sciences **Ketan Kotecha (Ed.), Machine Learning (Emerging Trends and Applications)**. Analyzing and modeling these temporal sequences for tasks such as classification (assigning a time series to a predefined category) or regression (predicting a continuous value associated with a time series) is a fundamental problem in machine learning **Time Series Classification: A review of Algorithms and.pdf**. However, applying standard machine learning algorithms directly to raw time series data is often challenging due to the inherent temporal structure and potentially high dimensionality of the sequences **Time Series Classification: A review of Algorithms and.pdf**. Effective representation of the time series characteristics is crucial for building accurate and robust models **Automated data processing and feature engineering for deep.pdf** **Time Series Classification: A review of Algorithms and.pdf**.

Traditional approaches to time series analysis and machine learning often rely on manual feature engineering, a process where domain experts handcraft relevant features from the raw data **Forecasting with time series imaging.pdf**   . While effective in specific contexts, this process is labor-intensive, requires significant expertise, and may not generalize well across different datasets or tasks **Forecasting with time series imaging.pdf** **Time Series Classification: A review of Algorithms and.pdf**. The increasing volume and complexity of modern time series data necessitate more automated and scalable approaches to data processing and feature extraction **Automated data processing and feature engineering for deep.pdf** **Forecasting with time series imaging.pdf**.

A prominent tool in this domain is `tsfresh` [@CHRIST201872], a Python package specifically designed for time series feature extraction based on scalable hypothesis tests **Automated dilated spatio-temporal synchronous graph modeling for traffic prediction.pdf** **Automated data processing and feature engineering for deep.pdf** **Chaos as an interpretable benchmark for forecasting and data-driven modelling.pdf** **Chemiresistive sensor array and machine learning classification of food.pdf** **Choose wisely: An extensive evaluation of model selection for anomaly detection in time series.pdf** **Event Stream GPT: a data pre-processing and modeling library for generative, pre-trained transformers over continuous-time sequences of complex events.pdf** **Forecasting: theory and practice.pdf** **AI-based rainfall prediction model for debris flows.pdf** **Choose wisely: An extensive evaluation of model selection for anomaly detection in time series.pdf**. `tsfresh` automates the process of calculating a diverse and large number of features from time series data. These features are derived from existing research and include distribution properties (e.g., mean, standard deviation, kurtosis), measures of autocorrelation (e.g., fast Fourier transform (FFT) and power spectral density coefficients), properties of linear regressors (e.g., gradient, standard error), energy, entropy, and stochasticity [@CHRIST201872]. After feature extraction, `tsfresh` also offers automated feature selection methods, such as using statistical tests like the Mann-Whitney U test, to identify and select the most relevant features for a specific task [@CHRIST201872].

Gridded time series data from satellites, senors and climate models, contain rich temporal information essential for applications like crop type classification, environmental monitoring, and natural resource management **Handbook on remote sensing bfor agricultural statistics.pdf**. Traditional methods rely heavily on manually engineered features, which are time-consuming, require domain expertise, and often lack scalability.

Traditional machine learning approaches are well-suited for analyzing gridded time series data from a variety of sources, including remote sensing platforms, in-situ sensors, and climate reanalysis products. These methods can effectively leverage both spatial and temporal patterns within the data, capturing key trends and anomalies across environmental variables  [@begue2018remote; @delince2017handbook]. Compared to deep learning architectures, traditional machine learning offers greater interpretability and lower computational overhead. Their transparent decision-making processes can be readily examined by domain experts, and they typically require less training data and computational power, making them ideal for many operational or resource-constrained applications [@hohl2024recent; @rs13132591;  @LI2023103345; @MA2019166]. Currently, no method exists to rapidly extract a comprehensive set of features from gridded time series data, such as those derived from remote sensing imagery. Existing packages like `tsfresh` are not optimized for the unique characteristics of gridded time series data, which often include irregular sampling intervals, missing values, and high dimensionality. This limitation hinders the ability to efficiently analyze and model these datasets, particularly in the context of remote sensing applications where large volumes of data are generated.

To address this gap, `xr_fresh` automates the extraction of salient temporal and statistical features from each pixelâ€™s time series. By leveraging automated feature extraction, `xr_fresh` reduces manual intervention and enhances reproducibility in remote sensing workflows.

## Problems and Background

A remote sensing image time series can be represented as a three-dimensional array with spatial dimensions $x$ and $y$, and temporal dimension $z$. Each pixel at location $(x_i, y_j)$ holds a time series:

$$
\mathcal{D} = \{ X_{i,j} \in \mathbb{R}^T \mid i = 1, \ldots, H; j = 1, \ldots, W \}
$$

where $H$ and $W$ are the height and width of the image, and $T$ is the number of temporal observations (e.g. monthly composites or daily acquisitions).

To prepare this data for use in supervised or unsupervised machine learning, each pixel time series $X_{i,j} = (x_{i,j,1}, x_{i,j,2}, \ldots, x_{i,j,T})$ is transformed into a feature vector:

$$
\vec{x}_{i,j} = \left(f_1(X_{i,j}), f_2(X_{i,j}), \ldots, f_M(X_{i,j})\right)
$$

where each $f_m$ is a time series feature extraction function (e.g. mean, variance, trend, autocorrelation), and $M$ is the total number of extracted features.

A visual representation of this transformation is shown in Figure 1. The feature extraction process is applied to each pixel's time series, resulting in a feature vector $\vec{x}_{i,j}$ for each pixel $(i,j)$.

![Feature Extraction Process](figures/feature extract.png)

This results in a 2D design matrix of features for the entire image:

$$
\mathbf{X}_{\text{features}} \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times M}
$$

This transformation effectively reduces the temporal complexity while preserving informative temporal patterns, enabling efficient training of spatial models or further aggregation to coarser spatial units (e.g., fields or regions).

If additional static features are available per pixel (e.g., soil type, elevation), these can be concatenated:

$$
\vec{x}_{i,j}^\text{final} = \left[ \vec{x}_{i,j} \,|\, \vec{a}_{i,j} \right] \in \mathbb{R}^{M + U}
$$

where $\vec{a}_{i,j} \in \mathbb{R}^U$ represents the $U$ univariate attributes at pixel $(i, j)$.
 
### Time Series Feature Set

The table below summarizes the suite of time series features extracted by the `xr_fresh` module from satellite imagery. These features are designed to characterize the temporal behavior of each pixel $(x_i, y_j)$, capturing key aspects of crop phenology and seasonal dynamics. By including a diverse set of statistical, trend, and distribution-based metrics, `xr_fresh` enables detailed and scalable analysis of temporal patterns relevant to remote sensing applications such as crop classification and environmental monitoring.

### Addtional Functionality  

Two common challenges in remote sensing time series data are the presence of missing values and the high dimensionality of the data. The `xr_fresh` library addresses these issues through advanced interpolation techniques and dimensionality reduction methods.

#### Interpolation

The `xr_fresh` library also includes functionality for interpolating missing values in the time series data. This is crucial for ensuring that the feature extraction process is not hindered by gaps in the data, which are common in remote sensing applications due to cloud cover or sensor errors. The interpolation methods implemented in `xr_fresh` are designed to be computationally efficient and can handle large datasets effectively.

Time series from remote sensing data often contain missing observations due to cloud cover or sensor gaps. The module supports advanced interpolation techniques including linear, nearest-neighbor, cubic spline, and univariate spline interpolation. These methods can utilize either regular intervals or explicitly provided date vectors to guide the interpolation along the temporal (z) dimension. Interpolation is applied pixel-wise to reconstruct continuous temporal profiles before feature extraction.

Formally, for a fixed pixel $(i, j)$, let the time series be:

$$
X_{i,j} = (x_{i,j,1}, x_{i,j,2}, \ldots, x_{i,j,T})
$$

where some $x_{i,j,t}$ may be missing due to clouds or sensor gaps. Interpolation estimates these missing values by fitting a function $f(t)$ to the observed time steps $\{t_k \in [1, T] \mid x_{i,j,t_k} \text{ is observed} \}$. The interpolated value at time $t$ is:

$$
\hat{x}_{i,j,t} = f(t), \quad \text{for } x_{i,j,t} \text{ missing}
$$

The function $f(t)$ may take the form of:

* **Linear interpolation:** $f(t) = a t + b$
* **Nearest neighbor:** $f(t) = x_{i,j,t_k}$ where $t_k = \arg\min_{t_k} |t - t_k|$
* **Cubic spline interpolation:** smooth piecewise cubic polynomials with continuity up to the second derivative
* **Univariate spline interpolation:** minimizes the penalized error

$$
\sum_k (x_{i,j,t_k} - f(t_k))^2 + \lambda \int (f''(t))^2 dt
$$

If acquisition times are irregular, time $t$ is replaced by a continuous index (e.g., days since first observation).

#### Dimensionality Reduction

For high-dimensional inputs or when the number of bands/time steps is large, dimensionality reduction can improve model interpretability and performance. `xr_fresh` integrates a GPU/CPU-parallelized Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) module using a radial basis function (RBF) kernel. The KPCA implementation samples valid observations for training, fits the kernel model, and projects each pixelâ€™s time series into a lower-dimensional space. The transformation is parallelized across spatial blocks using Ray and compiled with Numba for fast evaluation.

Formally, let $\mathbf{x}_{i,j} \in \mathbb{R}^T$ denote the time series vector for pixel $(i, j)$, where $T$ is the number of time steps or bands. KPCA first computes the kernel matrix $K$ using the RBF kernel:

$$
K(\mathbf{x}_a, \mathbf{x}_b) = \exp\left(-\frac{\|\mathbf{x}_a - \mathbf{x}_b\|^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
$$

where $\sigma$ is the kernel bandwidth parameter. The kernel matrix $K \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}$ (with $N$ the number of sampled pixels) is then centered and eigendecomposed:

$$
K_c = K - \mathbf{1}_N K - K \mathbf{1}_N + \mathbf{1}_N K \mathbf{1}_N
$$

where $\mathbf{1}_N$ is an $N \times N$ matrix with all entries $1/N$. The top $d$ eigenvectors $\{\mathbf{v}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_d\}$ corresponding to the largest eigenvalues are selected, and each pixelâ€™s time series is projected into the reduced space:

$$
\mathbf{z}_{i,j} = [\alpha_1 k(\mathbf{x}_{i,j}, \cdot), \ldots, \alpha_d k(\mathbf{x}_{i,j}, \cdot)]
$$

where $\alpha_k$ are the normalized eigenvectors. This yields a lower-dimensional representation $\mathbf{z}_{i,j} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ for each pixel, capturing the principal nonlinear temporal patterns in the data.

## Software Framework

`xr_fresh` achieves scalability by employing a combination of parallel and distributed computing strategies throughout both the feature extraction and dimensionality reduction stages. During feature extraction, functions are applied in parallel across spatial windows of the dataset using the `geowombat.series` context manager. The `apply` method enables multi-core processing via the `num_workers` parameter, distributing computation over spatial blocks (such as 256Ã—256 pixel windows) and efficiently utilizing all available CPU cores or distributed resources. Users can further extend functionality by defining custom feature extraction modules through subclassing `gw.TimeModule`, which are seamlessly integrated into the parallel pipeline and can leverage accelerated libraries like JAX, NumPy, or PyTorch for additional speedup.

For high-dimensional data, dimensionality reduction (such as Kernel PCA) is performed in a distributed manner. The dataset is divided into spatial chunks, each processed in parallel using Ray, a distributed execution framework. Within each chunk, Numba-compiled functions (using `@numba.jit(nopython=True, parallel=True)`) accelerate the transformation and exploit multi-threading at the block level. This two-level parallelismâ€”across blocks with Ray and within blocks with Numbaâ€”enables efficient scaling to very large datasets. The architecture is further supported by integration with Dask and xarray, which provide lazy evaluation, chunked computation, and seamless scaling from single machines to distributed clusters. Together, these strategies ensure that both feature extraction and dimensionality reduction are highly scalable, making `xr_fresh` suitable for operational use on large-scale remote sensing datasets.

## Case Study: Precipiation In Africa

As a demonstration of `xr_fresh`, we applied the package to a dataset of monthly precipitation estimates over East Africa, derived from the CHIRPS dataset in Figure 2. The goal was to extract features from the time series data for each pixel, enabling subsequent analysis and modeling.

![Precipitation input data](figures/precip.png)

```python
# create list of desired series
feature_list = {
    "minimum": [{}],
    "abs_energy": [{}],
    "doy_of_maximum": [{"dates": dates}],
    "mean_abs_change": [{}],
    "ratio_beyond_r_sigma": [{"r": 1}, {"r": 2}],
    "symmetry_looking": [{}],
    "sum": [{}],
    "quantile": [{"q": 0.05}, {"q": 0.95}],
}
from xr_fresh.extractors_series import extract_features_series

# Extract features from the geospatial time series
extract_features_series(image_list, feature_list, band_name, out_dir, num_workers=12, nodata=-9999)
```

The above code snippet demonstrates the use of `xr_fresh` to extract a set of features from the CHIRPS precipitation dataset. The `extract_features_series` function takes a list of files, a dictionary of desired features, and other parameters such as the band name and temporary directory for intermediate storage. The `num_workers` parameter allows for parallel processing across multiple CPU cores, significantly speeding up the feature extraction process.

![Time series feature set ](figures/features.png)

The extracted features found in Figure 3 can then be used for various applications, such as machine learning modeling, anomaly detection, or time series analysis. The flexibility of `xr_fresh` allows users to customize the feature extraction process according to their specific needs and datasets.




## Conclusion

`xr_fresh` is a powerful and efficient tool for automated feature extraction from gridded time series data in remote sensing applications. By leveraging advanced statistical methods and parallel computing, it enables the extraction of a comprehensive set of features that can significantly enhance the performance of machine learning models. The integration with existing Python geospatial libraries ensures that `xr_fresh` is easy to use and can be seamlessly incorporated into existing machine learning workflows. It also provides advanced interpolation and dimensionality reduction capabilities, addressing common challenges in remote sensing data analysis.
